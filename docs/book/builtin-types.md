# Builtin types

Type      | Meaning
:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------
`int`     | 32-bit signed integer, default type for integer literals
`int8`    | 8-bit signed integer
`int16`   | 16-bit signed integer
`int32`   | 32-bit signed integer
`int64`   | 64-bit signed integer
`uint`    | 32-bit unsigned integer
`uint8`   | 8-bit unsigned integer
`uint16`  | 16-bit unsigned integer
`uint32`  | 32-bit unsigned integer
`uint64`  | 64-bit unsigned integer
`float`   | 32-bit floating-point number, default type for floating-point literals
`float32` | 32-bit floating-point number
`float64` | 64-bit floating-point number
`bool`    | boolean
`char`    | C/C++ `char` type

## Arithmetic operators

There are the usual arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`,
`!`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, and the compound assignment counterparts
for the binary operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&&=`, `||=`, `&=`,
`|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`.

An important thing to note about `+`, `-`, and `*` is that they don't silently
wrap on overflow. Instead they raise an error (in checked mode), or invoke
undefined behavior (in unchecked mode) (not implemented yet). The wrapping
behavior can be enabled for individual operations with a special syntax (not
implemented yet).

### Increment and decrement operators

The increment and decrement operators, written as postfix `++` and `--`,
respectively, increment/decrement their operand by one. They can only be used as
standalone statements, not inside arbitrary expressions.

## Planned features

- More builtin type aliases, such as `byte`, `double`, `long`, `short`
- Exponentiation operator
