# Introduction

__Note:__ This page is incomplete and parts of it may be out of date.

C* is a modern system programming language designed as an alternative to C++,
C, and Rust. The primary goals of C* are programmer productivity and
performance. Memory safety is also a priority, but while C* improves on what
C++ and C have to offer, it doesn't go as far as Rust at the detriment of
ergonomics and productivity.

## Better compilation model

- No header files, no forward declarations. API definitions can be generated
  from the source code if needed.
- Programs are compiled as a whole, instead of compiling each file separately
  and then linking them together. This should make compiling faster as it leaves
  more room for optimizing the build process, and linking is usually quite slow.
- Libraries are imported as a whole, instead of importing individual files from
  them, freeing the user of the library from having to figure out which file to
  import for a specific feature, and freeing the library author from keeping the
  library's file structure the same for backwards compatibility.
- Every library is automatically wrapped inside their own namespace, no need to
  explicitly declare the namespace in each source file.

All of the above should result in faster compilation times and increased
programmer productivity compared to C and C++.

## Standard build system

Building a C* project is done with a single command: `cx build`, which
works out of the box without a single line of build configuration code. It finds
all C* source files in the project directory (recursively) and compiles them
into an executable. Additional build information, such as dependencies, can be
declared in a package configuration file. `cx build` will then download or
find these dependencies, and link them into the resulting executable.

No need to learn a new build system for each project, or manage project-specific
build scripts, which is often the case with C and C++ projects.

Long-term goal: include a built-in linting tool that runs during compilation to
enforce a specific coding style, or to disallow uses of certain language
features.

## Standard package manager

Using and distributing third-party libraries should be made as easy as possible.
For example, there should be no platform-specific dependency or release
management. Adding a dependency or publishing a library means running a single
command.

Initially supports fetching dependencies from Git repositories. Other version
control systems, binary distributions, system package managers, etc. will be
supported later.

## Faster than C and C++

More optimization opportunities:

- Moves are destructive, removing the need to reset moved-from objects and call
  their destructors, as is required in C++.
- Pointers can be declared non-aliasing either individually or globally with a
  compiler flag.
- The language provides a type-safe reallocation function for arrays, instead
  of just allocation and deallocation functions like C++. For example, the
  C* equivalent of C++'s `std::vector` makes use of this function.
- Unsigned integer overflow is undefined. There are still functions to do
  wrapping arithmetic on both signed and unsigned integers, when needed.
- Compiler is allowed to reorder struct fields. This can be prevented using an
  attribute or compiler flag.

C* uses the open-source LLVM library as a code generation back-end,
benefiting from all current and future optimizations implemented in LLVM.

No hidden expensive operations, like implicit calls to copy constructors and
copy assignment operators in C++.

## Improved syntax

C*'s syntax is clean, consistent, and similar to the C family of languages.

No C-style cast syntax, only C++-style casts and built-in type constructors.

### Examples of syntax

Syntax of a lambda returning the result of a single expression, with argument
type inference:

```
// C++
a([](auto& b) { return b.c(); });

// C*
a(b -> b.c());
```

Function pointer declaration:

```
// C/C++
void (*f)(int);

// C*
void(int) f;
```

## Simple and expressive language

- Only structs instead of having both struct and class.
- Only pointers instead of having both pointers and references. Note that C*
  pointers are not identical to C/C++ pointers.
- Member access always uses `.`, never `->`.
- Switch statement cases break automatically, avoids bugs caused by missing
  `break` in C and C++. Fallthrough is opt-in. Variables can also be declared
  inside switch cases without requiring a block.
- Simpler to parse, making it easier to implement syntax highlighting,
  auto-formatting, linting, etc.
- Single-parameter constructors are not implicit by default.
- Only one initialization syntax instead of [three](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization).
- The `static` keyword is not overloaded with 3 different meanings. C* uses
  it only for non-instance members.
- No built-in preprocessor, at least not in the same form as C and C++. C*
  only has the conditional compilation directive `#ifdef` and its friends, which
  can be configured only from the command-line, not from source code as can be
  done in C and C++ with `#define`. Although there is no preprocessor, C* may
  get macros in some form if it turns out the language needs them.

Semantics are more in line with usual programmer expectations:

- Read-only use of `operator[]` on maps doesn't insert a default-constructed
  element.
- Inline functions are actually inlined, at least in debug mode.
- The integer types `int` and `uint` are at least 32 bits.
- String literals are of type `StringRef`, so they know their size and have all
  string manipulation member functions.
- Array parameters aren't silently converted into pointers.

## Safer by default

C* inserts at least the following safety checks by default:

- Array bounds checks
- Integer overflow checks
- Null checks

These checks can be disabled individually or globally to make the code run
faster.

The compiler warns if a variable might be read before being initialized, for
example when passing it as an out parameter to a C function. If you know the
warning is safe to ignore, you can suppress it by assigning the keyword
`undefined` to the variable.

The compiler warns if a function's return value is ignored, by default. The
function can be annotated to suppress this behavior, if the return value is safe
to ignore. The call site can also explicitly declare the return value as unused
by assigning it to `_`, instead of casting to void. `_` is a magic identifier
which is also used in other contexts to mean "ignore this value".

## Transparent interoperation with existing C APIs

C headers can be imported directly from C* code. The Clang API is used to
parse the C headers and allow the contained declarations to be accessed from
C* code. C* functions can be declared `extern "C"` to enable calling them
from C.

Support for the same level of interoperability with C++ APIs is a longer-term
goal.

## Improved type system

Stronger typing to help avoid bugs and to make refactoring easier:

- No bug-prone implicit conversions between built-in types. Safe implicit
  conversions are still allowed, but may also be prevented with a compiler flag.
- All types are non-nullable by default. Nullable types are annotated with `?`.

Modern type system features for convenience and performance:

- Proper tagged union type to allow runtime polymorphism without dynamic
  allocation and virtual function calls.
    - C `union`: not type-safe, have to write a lot of wrapper code to call
      destructors and move/copy constructors/assignment operators.
    - C++17 `std::variant`: not easy or elegant to use (see
      https://bitbashing.io/std-visit.html).
- Using `interface`s (C*'s equivalent of C++ concepts) allows defining what
  kind of types are valid for a given template parameter when writing a generic
  type or function. This leads to much more readable error messages when
  instantiating generic types or functions with an incompatible type as the
  generic argument. C++-style unconstrained generic parameters are still allowed
  for flexibility.
- Arrays are first-class values that can be returned and passed by value. Arrays
  know their own size, either statically or at runtime.
- First-class tuples to allow e.g. returning multiple values or storing pairs of
  values in a container using a lightweight syntax.

## Standard library covers common use cases better

- More string manipulation functions, e.g. case-insensitive comparison, `split`,
  `join`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`.
- String and array slice types: `StringRef` and `ArrayRef`.
- Unicode-correct string type in addition to a raw byte string type.
- Algorithms take range objects instead of iterator pairs for ease of use.
- Iterable types in the standard library provide `map`, `filter`,
  `reduce`, etc. as member functions.
- File system library.
- Process library.
- Better math support:
    - Math functions can be evaluated at compile-time.
    - Standard library provides math constants such as Pi.

## Language features

### Destructuring

While iterating a map, the key and value from the key-value tuple can be
destructured into separate variables:

```
for (var (key, value) in myMap) {
    ...
}
```

Destructure the return value of a function returning multiple values as a tuple:

```
(int, bool) foo() {
    var a = 42;
    var b = false;
    return (a, b);
}

void main() {
    var (a, b) = foo();
}
```

### Compile-time reflection

Should cover common use cases such as iteration over enum cases, getting enum
case string representations, printing the active type of a union, etc. Should
follow the "pay only for what you use" principle.

### Named arguments

An optional way to avoid cryptic call sites like `foo(true, false)` by labeling
the arguments with the corresponding parameter name, with the compiler checking
that the argument labels match the parameter names, e.g.
`foo(a: true, b: false)`. Consequently, named arguments don't have to be in same
order as the parameters. This also enables function overloading on parameter
names.

### Defer statement

The `defer` keyword allows declaring arbitrary code, such as resource cleanup
functions, to be executed when exiting the current scope. In C++ one has to
write an RAII wrapper class to achieve this.

### Type inference

Type inference for local and global variables, to improve productivity and make
the code more amenable to type changes when refactoring. The strong type system
still has your back.

## …and all the good parts from C and C++

- Performance and control.
- Pay only for what you use.
- No garbage collection.
- Don't force the programmer to use a specific style.
- Have some implicit conversions and other features for convenience.
- Backwards compatibility eventually once the language design has stabilized.
