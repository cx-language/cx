        C* (pronounced "C star") is a C-based hybrid low-level/high-level programming language focused on runtime
        performance and developer productivity (in this order of priority). The language is simple and unopinionated,
        supporting imperative, generic, data-oriented, functional, and object-oriented programming.

        <h4>Performance</h4>
        C* compiles to efficient native code using LLVM. There's no garbage collection, hidden allocations, or runtime.
        C* takes a performance-first approach to common programming patterns, such as subtyping (tagged unions),
        map/filter/reduce (lazy iterators), and string/array handling (slices). Even fast compilation is a goal of C*.

        <h4>Expressiveness</h4>
        C* is a simple yet expressive language, featuring a strong type system with compile-time null-safety. It has all
        the features you'd except from a systems-level programming language, like pointers, RAII, templates, type
        inference, smart pointers, trait-like interfaces, and sum types. There's preprocessor, macros, or
        metaprogramming.

    <div class="block">
        <h4>Productivity</h4>
        C* allows effortless language interop: import C headers directly without the need for bindings. The clean and
        familiar C-like syntax avoids unnecessary boilerplate, allowing you to get instantly productive without a steep
        learning curve. Debug builds check for buffer or arithmetic overflows by default.
