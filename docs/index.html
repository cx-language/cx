            <h1>C* is a language designed for <strong>performance and productivity</strong>.</h1>
            <p>
                C* (pronounced “C star”) is a hybrid low-level / high-level programming language focused on runtime
                performance and developer productivity, in this order of priority. The language is simple and
                unopinionated, has a clean C-like syntax, and supports imperative, generic, data-oriented, functional,
                and object-oriented programming.

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        C* compiles to efficient native code using LLVM. There's no garbage collection, hidden allocation, or runtime.
        C* takes a performance-first approach to common programming patterns, such as subtyping (tagged unions),
        map/filter/reduce (lazy iterators), and string/array handling (slices). Even fast compilation is a goal of C*.

    <div class="block">
        <h2>Expressiveness</h2>
        C* is a simple yet expressive language, featuring a strong type system with compile-time null-safety, sum types,
        and trait-like interfaces. It has both high-level programming constructs and support for systems-level
        programming, such as pointers, destructors, and generics. There are no preprocessor or macros.
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>Productivity</h2>
        C* has great C interop: C headers can be imported directly without the need for bindings. The clean and familiar
        C-like syntax avoids unnecessary boilerplate, and allows C/C++ programmers to instantly get productive
        without a steep learning curve. Debug builds check for buffer or arithmetic overflows by default.
